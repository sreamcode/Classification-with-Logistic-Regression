# Logistic Regression Binary Classification

This project demonstrates binary classification using Logistic Regression on a dataset saved as `data.csv`. It includes steps to:

- Load and preprocess the data, including missing value imputation
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Standardize the features
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score
- Visualize the ROC curve
- Demonstrate sigmoid function and threshold tuning

To run this project:
1. Install the required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2. Execute the Jupyter Notebook provided.
